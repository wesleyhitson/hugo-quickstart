Following the [Hugo quickstart guide](https://gohugo.io/getting-started/quick-start/).

I ended up having to use Git Bash for all of this. I tried in WSL and was unable to get it working. I believe the Ubuntu Hugo version is out of date (I believe 0.68), vs the current version of 0.129. Powershell also does not work, per the guide.
